# MO3ALIMI

## About the Project

*MO3ALIMI* is a platform designed to help illiterate adults learn the basics of literacy, including alphabets, writing, reading, and basic numeracy. Users receive personalized quizzes that assist them in learning and practicing simultaneously.

## Difficulties and Challenges

Initially, we attempted to use LLaMA3 to generate questions, but it did not produce the desired output. When prompted to generate questions in a certain structure, it generated Python code instead, which was not useful for our project. Consequently, we switched to using Gemini Pro’s API, which, given a well-crafted prompt, generated exactly what we needed.

After resolving the language model problem, we focused on building an interface that connects to the user and converts the questions generated by Gemini into quizzes, text windows, or voice recognition outputs.

We began by developing a chatbot using Gradio that encompassed all the functionalities. However, when we tried to create quizzes from Gemini’s responses, we found Gradio to be very limited. Therefore, we moved to Streamlit. With Streamlit, we managed to create an interface that generated quizzes based on a JSON database. However, when connecting to the Gemini API to control the contents of the questions and generate its own JSON file, we encountered an error: TypeError: string indices must be integers when trying to convert JSON file to quizzes. This issue was critical as it prevented us from generating quizzes dynamically, and despite our efforts, we were unable to resolve it, which is essential for the success of the project.
